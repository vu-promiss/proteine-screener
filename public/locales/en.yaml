  title: Welcome to the Protein Screener (Pro55+)
  professionals: |
    The Protein Screener (Pro55+) is a short questionnaire that can be used to
    estimate the chance on a low protein intake (<0.8, <1.0, or <1.2 gram /per kilogram
    adjusted body weight/day) in older adults (55+ year).
    *The Protein screener (Pro55+) is developed by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
    (the Netherlands). [See publications](/#/publications)*
    
    You can use the Protein Screener (Pro55+) here for free. After completing
    the questions, you will immediately see the chance (0-100%) on a low protein intake
    and advice how to apply chance this in research and practice.
           
    When there is a high risk on a low protein intake, we recommend to perform a
    more precise measurement of the actual protein intake, for example by
    a full nutritional assessment performed by a dietitian.

    Consuming **sufficient** protein is important to preserve muscle and bone mass. 
    From the age of 50 we graduately lose muscle mass. This loss can be recuced
    by consuming sufficient protein with our food and by regular physical activity.
    By filling in this questionnaire you will get an estimate
    on whether or not your current protein intake may be too low. 
    This questionnaire is developed for adults aged 55 years and older.

    After filling out this short questionnaire consisting of 13 questions, you will immediately see:
 
    1. An estimate on whether or not your current protein intake may be too low
    2. How many grams of protein you are adviced to consume per day, based on your age, body height and weight
    3. Advice on where to find more information on protein intake

    explanation: |
      ##### Explanation on how to use the predicted probability

      - A predicted probability of more than 40% is considered as a high risk on
      a protein intake < 0.8 gram /kilogram (adjusted) body weight/day
      - A predicted probability of more than 30% is considered as a high risk on
      a protein intake < 1.0 gram /kilogram (adjusted) body weight/day
      - A predicted probability of more than 20% is considered as a high risk on
      a protein intake < 1.2 gram /kilogram (adjusted) body weight/day

      Based on the norm ≥{norm} gram /kilogram (adjusted) body weight/day
      the personal advice for protein intake is: ≥{protein_target} gram/day.

      ##### Advice for use in health care
     
      When there is a high risk on a low protein intake, we recommend to perform a
      more precise measurement of the actual protein intake, for example by
      a full nutritional assessment performed by a dietitian or by filling in
      an online tool to record food intake for at least 3 days.

      ##### Advice for use in research:
        
      Depending on the purpose of research, one may choose a (different) cut-off
      for the predicted probability. For example, a lower cut-off will result in
      a higher sensitivity when screening for low protein intake but also
      a higher chance on a false positive screening result.

      **We estimate that your current protein intake is *lower* than recommended** based
      on your age, body height and weight ({age} year, {length}cm, {weight}kg).

      We would advice you to discuss this information with for example a dietitian.
      A dietitian can perform a more precise measurement of your actual protein intake.
      He/she can also provide you with nutritional advice and/or tips, depending on
      your personal preferences, on how to consume more protein with your diet. 
    adequate: |
      We estimate that your current protein intake is **sufficient** based
      on your age, body height and weight ({age} year, {length}cm, {weight}kg).

      We would advice you to fill out the Protein Screener again when there is
      a change in your dietary habits.

# Quiz
intro.text: |
  The following questions are about your dietary habits. It is very important
  that you give an honest response. We would like to know what you ate or drank
  in the last 4 weeks (irrespective of week days, weekend days, at home or someplace
  else). If the last 4 weeks were very special (for example you were sick or you
  went on a vacation and this had a major influence on your usual diet), please
  recall the 4 weeks before this period.
